It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

system. One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NLC2J18H29B","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"SpongeBob Squarepants - Lost Treasures","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29558.13710308634073071.40022416-ba45-4e2e-9a59-c338db373ba2.2f28cda0-95c4-427a-bcb3-9df76f4aab29","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50754.13710308634073071.ba4dad2c-3757-494c-9656-7fe3a786a69f.ab5ff2ae-0423-4fe5-a7d3-27f31afcdd9d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["39135goatgame.SpongeBobSquarepants-LostTreasures_p6fh3swgmjcvc"],"ContentIds":["1e4ab169-a503-fd12-e7c1-2babedd31ffd","8080267e-2270-5d92-5987-b60398f21741"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Mr. Crabbs, somewhere in the warehouse, lost his glasses, his whistle and his false jaw.

As you may know, most Spider Solitaire games are not winnable even though you play your best. That's where we come in.

Now you can truly enjoy the game. \r\nDownload and have fun playing Spider Solitaire Mobile!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Solvable deals that have at least one winning solution\r\n✓ 1 suit, 2 suits and 4 suits games\r\n✓ Advanced Hint option\r\n✓ Unlimited Undo\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop or Tap to move cards\r\n✓ Unmovable cards will be greyed out\r\n✓ Nice sound effects and music\r\n✓ Daily/monthly/all time highscores\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ HOW TO PLAY ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ The goal of the game is to create sets of cards that start with a king, queen and jack and end with an ace. Completed sets of cards will be automatically removed from the board and you score points. In order to win you have to remove all the cards from the board.\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop cards or simply tap on the cards to move them on an eligible column.\r\n✓ In games with more than one suit, in order for a set to be complete, all the cards in that column need to be in order and of the same suit. When you are successful in building a set, these will be automatically removed from the board. \r\n✓ You are allowed to mix different suits as long as the cards are in a descending order. But you cannot move the stacks, unless they're of the same suit.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place any card or any stack there.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves, tap on the stock pile at the bottom of the screen to be dealt a new row of cards.\r\n✓ You can only deal a new row of cards when all the columns are filled. Place at least one card on every column to be allowed to be dealt new rows of cards.\r\n✓ By default the set number of suits is 2. But you can change it from the main menu. To enter the main menu and to also pause the game just press on the button in the top left corner of the screen. You can change the number of suits from 2 to 4, from 4 to 1 and from 1 to 2. The changes take effect when you start a new game. \r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCM3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"SoulCraft","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26697.9007199266251390.e266595a-4058-42fc-b45d-aea1c944ec77.96411d1d-6eac-439d-98e6-a0e6744a5cf3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0d73d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38719.9007199266251390.edf570de-007f-4bd5-9f43-33b1dd2d778e.698ffbab-d654-42a8-a79e-3b993c20c85e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0d73d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"185","PackageFamilyNames":["MobileBitsGmbH.SoulCraft_n3knxnwpdbgdc"],"ContentIds":["22573932-81ef-fa16-95ab-ab97c2617f6e","e664d1ce-b6b8-6ea3-3202-fd7674d34c45"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"SoulCraft is the best free2play Action RPG game for Windows 8.

That’s right, you shoot those marbles with other marbles in order to remove marbles. Sounds silly, but that's how it is! Aim with your Tiki stone to shoot marbles of the same color into the chain. If you match 3 or more marbles they will disappear.\r\n\r\nBigger combos will grant bigger bonuses and even specials. And if that’s not enough for you there are power ups that will assist you greatly in your challenge to eliminate brightly colored rolling marbles.\r\n\r\nOf course there are power ups. For example there is a fire power-up that will allow you to spit awesome fire balls for a short amount of time and destroy all marbles that get in the way. No need to match 3 marbles, just shoot fireballs wherever you want.\r\n\r\nAnother fan favorite is the lightning power-up that will randomly shoot lightning beams and destroy several marbles across the screen at once. A really helpful feature is the option to swap between two marbles before every shot. If you don’t find a good spot to shoot a marble, swapping may give you a big advantage.\r\n\r\nBut either way your one and only goal is to destroy the whole chain of marbles before the first marble reaches the exit. So your main antagonist is time. And your aiming skills, of course.\r\n\r\nIf you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe, World of Zuma or Zumas Temple Quest, you will love this game. Zuma Totemia is the perfect game for all Match 3 fans that want a little more action and excitement. As a classic marble shooter it adds a time component and a lot of levels to master.\r\n\r\nIt’s a marble game that is as action-packed as it is challenging.

If there’s one thing we know how to do is how to have terrific garage sales! There is a saying that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure which we believe is very true. So, today we are organizing a neighborhood Garage Sale. This annual event has become a drawing card for treasure hunters from all over the town, where everyone can benefit as both a buyer and a seller.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that this garage sale is one of the most successful in the country. Karen, Sarah and Thomas are customers at our neighborhood garage sale. Consistently finding the good stuff at yard sales is their mission. Like any mission, it requires strategy. They have prepared themselves how to choose their target, plan their attack, assemble the necessary gear, and get in and out fast.

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDN78W","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Type to Pop","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61120.9007199266464960.c3cea2db-c2a5-4128-b24d-09cdd43ec936.ec48dfee-5d44-4fcf-a3e3-460501e7abe9","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0892d8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50156.9007199266464960.93249552-af2e-4f88-8690-c37e877f8d2b.88ae046e-a358-4abe-a62c-788d6dd37a92","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0892d8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["28111AshishMishra.TypetoPop_yx16r8sffspeg"],"ContentIds":["a9cd88fc-89f4-a6c8-6005-26b982df155d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is a Typing Tutor  for kids.
